Welcome to the Music Cupid Compatibility App!

Music Cupid is a dating/compatibility app that matches users based on their music taste! 

When users sign up, they must pick their 5 favorite songs from a spotify database provided by Kaggle. 
After they sign up and complete their profile, they can browse through other users' profiles and calculate their music compatibility score!
The music compatibility score is calculated by an AI model by assessing certain factors of the music, such as genre, danceability, energy, and more!
Once matches are made, users can access each others' email addresses and contact each other through there. 

Technologies used: React, Next.js, python, flask, sklearn, pymongo, and MongoDB Atlas
